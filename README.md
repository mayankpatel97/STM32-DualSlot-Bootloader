This bootloader for the STM32 microcontroller provides a robust and feature-rich solution for firmware updates. The bootloader is designed to facilitate firmware updates via the internal USB or UART interfaces, utilizing an external SPI Flash to store firmware temporarily.

# Key Features

- Dual Slot Firmware Storage: The bootloader manages two separate slots in external SPI Flash to store different versions of firmware. This allows for safe firmware updates with rollback capability.
  
- Firmware Rollback: In case of an update failure, the bootloader can revert to the previous working firmware, ensuring the device remains operational.
  
- CRC16 Validation: Each firmware stored in the SPI Flash is validated using CRC16 checks to ensure data integrity and prevent corrupted firmware from being executed.

- Encrypted Storage: The bootloader keeps all firmware data stored in SPI Flash in an encrypted form, enhancing security against unauthorized access.

- Version Management: The bootloader can report the current firmware version, helping in maintaining and tracking the firmware versions deployed on the device.

- External Python Script: A Python script is provided to assist with loading new firmware onto the device. This script also facilitates version reporting and other bootloader-related operations.


# Prerequisites

- Hardware: STM32 microcontroller with USB and UART interfaces.
- External Storage: SPI Flash module connected to the microcontroller.
- Software: Python installed on your host machine for running the external script.

# Building the Bootloader

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mayankpatel97/STM32-SPIFLASH-UART-BOOTLOADER.git
   cd STM32-SPIFLASH-UART-BOOTLOADER
   ```
2. Configure the bootloader using your preferred IDE (e.g., STM32CubeIDE) or via command line.

3. Build the bootloader project and flash it onto your STM32 microcontroller.

# Using the Bootloader

1. Connect your STM32 device to your computer via USB or UART.

2. Run the provided Python script to load new firmware:
   ```bash
   python firmware_loader.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --file firmware.bin
   ```

3. The script will automatically handle the transfer, validation, and version management.

4. After the firmware is successfully loaded, the bootloader will perform a CRC16 check and either boot into the new firmware or revert to the previous version if an error is detected.

# Rollback Procedure

In case of an issue with the newly loaded firmware, the bootloader automatically reverts to the previous firmware stored in the other slot, ensuring the device remains operational.

# Checking Firmware Version

To check the currently running firmware version, use the following command:
```bash
python firmware_loader.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --version
```
